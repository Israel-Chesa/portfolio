								<h3>Hi-Tech Business Analysis</h3>
								<p>Conducted a business performance analysis in Power BI,

								<h3>Health Insights Report</h3>

									(RHR) of 52.90 bpm, a Heart Rate Variability (HRV) [LF/HF Ratio] of 1.39, and an RMSSD of 35.05 ms, 
									suggesting some stress but a normal daily stress index. Sleep quality was good, averaging 
									6 hours and 55 minutes, with healthy SpO2 levels. I recommended maintaining regular exercise, 
									stress management, a consistent sleep schedule, and a restful sleep environment, while continuing to 
									monitor these health metrics for balanced heart health, optimal sleep, and manageable stress.</p>
